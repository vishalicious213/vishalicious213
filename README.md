# VISH SINGH
FRONT-END WEB DEVELOPER / FULL-STACK INTERLOPER

I'm a 20+ year I/T veteran who took the step from software design to development, with a focus on web applications. Much of my experience comes from helping to build a clinical EMR for nursing homes, including research, planning, writing specifications, designing the front-end and testing. I work with end users across clinical disciplines and administration to ensure that software meets their needs - and all state and federal requirements.

Core technologies that I use JavaScript, React, SQL, Node and Python. HTML and CSS play a big role in my work as JSX and Styled Components.
